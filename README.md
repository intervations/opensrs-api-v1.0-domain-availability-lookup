# About

This CFC is to facilitate making calls to the OpenSRS Domains API.

As a reseller of domains from OpenSRS/Tucows for over ten(10) years, we code exclusively using Coldfusion/Lucee.

We are embarking on a unique integration of the OpenSRS API platform with an aim to give our many customers the tools they need for everyday domain management tasks.

The Coldfusion OpenSRS API Domain availability lookup code is just a small piece. We are publishing it here for free for all to use without limitations, we just ask that you support this repository by sponsoring us by buying us a coffee at the link below.
